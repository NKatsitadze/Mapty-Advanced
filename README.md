# Mapty-Advanced
Mapty is a simple app where you can save your workouts info like
workout place, duration, distance, cadence and elevation gain (for cyclists).

I added features like editing your workout, deleting specific, or 
all workouts together (reset), saving your workouts to local storage 
so your info does not get lost and loading it when you open Mapty.
+ I also integrated openweathermap API, so for each workout you can 
see what's the weather like on that specific location at current time.

Optimised for every screen size and browser.
(don't forget to allow/turn on location services)
